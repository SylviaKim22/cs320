To ensure that my coding is functional and secured, I used multiple testings that tested the compatibilities of my coding. I used different tests to ensure everythings working well and secured from different types of attacks.
To interpret user needs I need to be able to first visualize and retrieve the needed requirements from the clients and user feedback. 8ncorporating the needs into a program would be implementing the necessary coding and structure needed based on their work and requirements.
When designing software you have to have a good understanding of the requirements and to visualize your design and how you want it to register based onncertain inputs. Also, knowing how many non-functional and functional requirements are necessary.
